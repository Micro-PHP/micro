# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub][github-pull-requests].


## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Extended Coding Style][link-psr-12]** - Check the code style with ``$ composer check-style`` and fix it with ``$ composer fix-style``.

- **Add tests** -- Your patch will not be accepted if it does not have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** -- Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** -- We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0][link-semver-website]. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** -- Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** -- If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** -- Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them][link-git-squash-tutorial] before submitting.


## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
